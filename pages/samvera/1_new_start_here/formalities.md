# Formalities

## Membership in GitHub organizations and repositories

First things first: sign up for a GitHub account. All development work within the Samvera community takes place on GitHub.

When you begin doing Samvera development, you'll want the ability to push your work directly to Samvera-managed codebases. Fortunately, the community of developers is quite informal about this -- ask (on one of the established community [communication channels](communication.html)) to be added as a contributor to the codebase you're working on and you generally will be added in short order.
