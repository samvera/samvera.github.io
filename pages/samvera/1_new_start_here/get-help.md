### Chat Channels, Email Lists, Telephone Calls, Wiki Pages

There are many ways to ask for for help from the community, whether your question is about developing, metadata, project planning, or institutional policies. This page contains contact information for all of these points of interest.

## Slack

For technical questions, the first place to reach people is in the Samvera Slack Team's channel #dev.

- [Samvera Slack team](https://samvera.slack.com)

Joining the Slack team requires an invitation, but anyone can generate an automatic invite using this [form](http://slack.samvera.org/). (If this form does not work, you may want to use this backup [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cRJaOTo2pHAeMzfE3hKL3toPHF2_e4ZXw3ufOXlF2vU/viewform). If you need help getting connected, ping slack@samvera.org and someone will be in touch.

Several Samvera Partners use Slack within their institutions for team communication and collaboration. There is a Samvera Slack team that is used for discussion, questions, announcements, interest groups, and working groups. Anyone can create a new channel within the Samvera Slack team once they have registered for an account.

A tutorial can be found [here](https://samvera.slack.com/getting-started). Slack has clients for Mac, PC, Linux, and mobile devices, and may be used via any web browser.

## Calls

## IRC

While the #samvera room in IRC is in continuous use, most conversations now take place on Slack (as of spring/summer 2016).

**Server: chat.freenode.net
Channel: #samvera**

If you don't already use an IRC client, connect through the web at http://webchat.freenode.net/

## Samvera Wiki

The [Samvera Wiki](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/overview) has a wealth of information, and is the place where working groups are formed and track their progress, where the technical calls record their agendas and meetings notes. You need an account for the Samvera Wiki so that you can contribute to Samvera's pages. If you do not have one already, please request an account by sending an email to heather@samvera.org.

## Samvera Connect, Partner & Steering Group Meetings

Once each academic year, there is a global Samvera Connect meeting; this is a chance for all Samvera Partners and users to meet at one time in one place to promote connections and collaboration throughout the rest of the year. The Samvera Partners also gather for a multi-day (usually three), face-to-face meeting a couple of times a year. These events provide regular forums for partners to focus on aligning road maps, coordinating resources, and extending the technical, community, documentation and training framework. See the Samvera Partner Meetings page for more details. The Samvera Steering Group, a smaller group of institutions that stewards the overall effort and provides central administration, also meets separately during these sessions.
