### Chat Channels, Email Lists, Telephone Calls, Wiki Pages

There are many ways to ask for for help from the community, whether your question is about developing, metadata, project planning, or institutional policies. This page contains contact information for all of these points of interest.

## Slack

For technical questions, the first place to reach people is in the Samvera Slack Team's channel #dev.

- [Samvera Slack team](https://samvera.slack.com)

Joining the Slack team requires an invitation, but anyone can generate an automatic invite using this [form](http://slack.samvera.org/). (If this form does not work, you may want to use this backup [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cRJaOTo2pHAeMzfE3hKL3toPHF2_e4ZXw3ufOXlF2vU/viewform). If you need help getting connected, ping slack@samvera.org and someone will be in touch.

Several Samvera Partners use Slack within their institutions for team communication and collaboration. There is a Samvera Slack team that is used for discussion, questions, announcements, interest groups, and working groups. Anyone can create a new channel within the Samvera Slack team once they have registered for an account.

A tutorial can be found [here](https://samvera.slack.com/getting-started).  Slack has clients for Mac, PC, Linux, and mobile devices, and may be used via any web browser.

## Calls

- **Technical Call**

  There is a weekly Samvera technical call for developers and other folks who are contributing code or are actively using the core Samvera plugins & components.

  Wednesdays at 9:00 AM Pacific Time, noon Eastern Time
  Check out this helpful [time zone](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=12&day=6&year=2010&hour=8&min=0&sec=0&p1=224) translation

  Connect via [Zoom](https://psu.zoom.us/j/613720745), which will launch the Zoom client. Instructions to connect by telephone are included at the top of [the agenda for each call](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Notes+from+Meetings+and+Calls).  

- **Monthly Partner Call**

  There is a monthly Samvera Partners call among (signed) partners. This call complements the technical calls (above), but instead of a focus on code, the Partners call focuses on community & functional progress.

  2nd Friday of the month
  8:30 AM - 9:30 AM Pacific Time
  Check out this helpful [time zone](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=12&day=6&year=2010&hour=8&min=0&sec=0&p1=224) translation

  This call used to use the conference line above but has recently been exploring other systems.  For a given call, check the agenda on the right of the Samvera Partner Calls page for the dial-in (etc) information.

## IRC

  While the #samvera room in IRC is in continuous use, most conversations now take place on Slack (as of spring/summer 2016).

  **Server: chat.freenode.net
  Channel: #samvera**

  If you don't already use an IRC client, connect through the web at http://webchat.freenode.net/
  Nickname: pick a name,
  Channels: #samvera

  For more information on how to start using irc, check out the instructions on the [code4lib](http://code4lib.org/irc) site.

## DuraSpace Wiki

The [DuraSpace Wiki](Samvera Wiki (this site) http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera) has a wealth of information, and is the place where working groups are formed and track their progress, where the technical calls record their agendas and meetings notes. You need an account for the DuraSpace Wiki so that you can contribute to Samvera's pages. If you do not have one already, please request an account by sending an email to sysadmin@duraspace.org.

## Samvera Connect, Partner & Steering Group Meetings

Once each academic year, there is a global Samvera Connect meeting; this is a chance for all Samvera Partners and users to meet at one time in one place to promote connections and collaboration throughout the rest of the year. The Samvera Partners also gather for a multi-day (usually three), face-to-face meeting a couple of times a year. These events provide regular forums for partners to focus on aligning road maps, coordinating resources, and extending the technical, community, documentation and training framework. See the Samvera Partner Meetings page for more details. The Samvera Steering Group, a smaller group of institutions that stewards the overall effort and provides central administration, also meets separately during these sessions.
