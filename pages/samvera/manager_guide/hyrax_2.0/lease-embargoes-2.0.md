The Embargo management page contains three tabs:
- All Active Embargoes: Works where embargoes are current

- Deactivated Embargoes: Works that are currently out of embargo status and access status has been changed

To deactivate embargoes:
- Click the “Expired Active Embargoes” tab
- Select works to release (optionally leave all files in embargo state by unchecking the box “Change all files within work __ to _ status _ )
- Click button “Deactivate Embargoes for Selected” or deactivate individually
