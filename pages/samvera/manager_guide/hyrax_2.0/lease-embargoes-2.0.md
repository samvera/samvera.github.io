## Leases

**Leases do not automatically expire. Leases need to be updated manually.**

To manage leases, go to `repository-url/leases`

The Manage Leases page contains three tabs:

- All Active Leases: Works where leases are current
- Expired Active Leases: Works where leases are expired but they are still available and access status has not been changed
- Deactivated Leases: Works that are out of lease and access status has been changed

To deactivate leases:

- Click the “Expired Active Leases” tab
- Select works to release (optionally leave all files in lease state by unchecking the box “Change all files within work _ to _ status \_ )
- Click button “Deactivate Leases for Selected” or deactivate individually.
