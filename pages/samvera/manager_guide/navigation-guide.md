# Main navigation

## Submit contact form
There is a contact  form link on all pages that use the homepage layout. Example (non-working) URL: https://insertyourtenanthere.demo.hydrainabox.org/contact

## Change the language used on the site
Change the language from English to other supported languages using the link in the top navigation bar on any page. The labels, descriptions, etc. are switched to the selected language.

## View your notifications
Access user notifications using the notification link (insert image?) in the top navigation bar on any page. The Notification page’s main content consists of a “Notifications” header, and list of notifications with columns displaying the date, subject, and message of each, as well as a “Delete All” button in the top right. Notifications referring to specific items in the repository will include an active link to the item. The page’s left sidebar highlights its “Notifications” item also, under “Your Activity”.
Notifications can also be accessed via the Dashboard (see below).
