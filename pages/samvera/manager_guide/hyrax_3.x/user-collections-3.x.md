This page focuses on the basics of an end user creating a collection. For a detailed overview of collection types and configurations, please visit the Collection configuration and [Admin Sets](https://samvera.github.io/administrative-sets-3.x.html) section of this website.

Collections can be displayed under the "Explore Collections" tab on the Hyrax homepage. Currently, repository administrators cannot configure which collections display in this tab. The list consists of the first five results of the collections that the user has permission to see, ordered by ascending timestamp. Therefore, the oldest untouched collections will appear.

#Create a User Collection

To access the Collections list:

1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Click on Collections in the sidebar

![screenshot of collections page](\images\screenshots\collections-2.1.png)

To create a new collection:

1. Click on the "New Collection" button at the top of the screen
2. If the repository contains more than one collection type, then a dialog box will pop up, giving you the option to select a collection type for the new collection. Depending on the settings defined for the collection types within a repository, some collection types may not be available to all users of the system. Users will only see choices for collection types that they have permissions to create.
3. Select a collection type and click "Create Collection"
4. Enter a title for the collection and additional metadata if desired.
5. Click "Save"

You can only set visibility and sharing AFTER the collection is created.

## Adding Works to Collections

The visibility of a collection does not affect the visibility of a work. For example, if a Public work is added to a Private collection, the work will remain Public, but a link to the collection itself can not be discovered. Additionally, if the user does not have permission to view a restricted work in a shared collection, they will not be able to see the work in the collection edit page.

There are several ways to add works to collections. Note that all of these options require the collection to have already been created.

### Adding Works to Collections from the Dashboard

1. From the Dashboard, click"Works"
2. Select one or more works
3. Click the "Add to Collection" button
4. Select the collection in the dialog box, then click "Save Changes"
