# Editing a Work

There are two views for works: Browse view and Edit view. The public-facing view of a work is the Browse view. A user will navigate to a work and then click “Edit” to access the edit view. As an admin user, you would be able to edit any work in the repository.

In the edit view for a work, you can change the description, add files, edit relationships, edit sharing, and edit visibility. If you edit any of these settings, you must click “Save” in order to apply your changes. Note that if you add files, you must recheck the deposit agreement before saving.

If you edit the sharing or visibility of the work, you can either opt to have all files in the work inherit these permissions, or you can opt to have the individual files retain their permissions so that they can be edited manually.

Set child/parent work: In the “Relationships” tab, you can now add a child or parent work to the work - this is only available after the work is deposited, not at the time of deposit. A child work added to this work will appear as an Item in this work. A parent work will add this work to its Items. To add a child or parent work, enter the title of the work under “Child Work” or “Parent Work” and click “Add”. Click “Save” to apply your changes.

## Editing a work - file manager
To change the order of files in a work or set a representative file, you have to use the File Manager. In the Browse view of a work, click “File Manager”.
Setting representative file: In the File Manager, select “Representative Media” for the file that you would like to be featured as the representative file in the work. Click “Save” to apply your changes.

- Ordering files: In the File Manager, click and drag files into the order that you would like them to appear in the work. Click “Save” to apply your changes.

## Editing a file
In the Browse view of a work, the files in the work are listed under “Items”
There are two views for files: Browse view and Edit view. The public-facing view of a file is the Browse view. In the Browse view of a file, click “Edit” to access the edit view.

In edit view, the user can edit the file description, upload a new version of the file, and change the permissions.
Edit description: In the “Descriptions” tab, enter a new file title in the “Title” field. Click “Update Attached File” to save changes.

## Uploading a new version
Permissions: Visibility and sharing permissions can also be set at the file level, in the “Permissions” tab. As a default, all files have the same permissions as the containing work. This can be edited in the “Permissions” tab for each file.
