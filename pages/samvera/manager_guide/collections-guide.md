# Collections

Collections are useful for creating landing pages and allowing users to link to related documents in the repository.

Common use-cases might include:

- Research materials by a faculty member, lab, or research center
- Student work from an degree program, such as Masters theses or Dissertations
- Books on a certain topic, from a certain time period, or from a certain publisher

## Create a new collection
From the Dashboard, click on Create Collection to get started. Collections require Descriptions and Visibility settings to be created.

- Descriptions: The required descriptive metadata is Title. Users can describe Collections in the same way they describe Works (i.e. the same set of metadata fields are available).
- Visibility: Unlike Works, Collections cannot be Embargoed or Leased. The options are Open Access, Institution, and Private.

## Adding Works to a collection

### Works You deposited

You may add works that you deposited to any collection you created by going to My Works '/dashboard/works', selecting works you want to add, then clicking on Add to Collection.

### Works Deposited by others (Admin Users)

As a repository administrator, you can add any work to any collection by going to the work page '/concern/generic_works/[PID]', clicking Edit, Relationships, select the collection, Save.

## View your Collections
From the Dashboard, click on Collections under Repository Contents. This will present you with a table of Your Collections (collections you own) including the collection title, date added, visibility, and a drop down menu of Actions you can take on the collection (edit or delete collection).

Selecting Edit Collection will present you with a form that allows you to modify three major pieces of information for the collection (all are tabs across the top of the interface):

- Description: this interface allows you to modify descriptive information about the collection, add works to the collection, and manage items in the collection:
Modify descriptive information including:
  - the Title of the collection
  - a Thumbnail image to represent the collection visually. The thumbnail selection interface requires a search for an item in the repository, the thumbnail of which will be used as the collection thumbnail.
- Visibility: this interface allows you to modify the Visibility settings for the collection with the options of Public, Institution, or Private. The interface also includes an Update Collection button that will save the visibility change and a Cancel button that cancels the visibility change edits you may have made.
- Sharing: this interface offers the ability to share the collection with other users or groups and to set the access settings for those users or groups.

In addition, the Collection interface allows you to add works to the collection, search the collection, and manage items in the collection:

- Add Works by selecting the Add Works button below the Descriptions area, this will send you to the View Your Works page (see above) to select works to add to the collection.
- Manage Items in this Collection: this area includes a table of works in the collection with the title, date added, visibility, actions you can take on the work. Actions include:
  - Remove from Collection
  - Edit Work
  - Delete Work
  - Highlight Work on Profile
  - Transfer Ownership of Work
- Search Collection: Search the collection by entering search terms in the Search Collection search box and selecting the Go button. Results of the search will appear in a new page with a table of results that includes work title, date uploaded, visibility, and a drop down menu of Actions you can take on the item (Edit or Highlight Work on Profile).

Selecting Delete Collection will return a pop-up window asking if you are sure you want to delete the collection with the options of Cancel or OK. Selecting Cancel will return you to the Collections interface. Selecting OK will return you to the Collections interface with the collection in question removed from the table.
