The Notification page’s main content consists of a “Notifications” header, and list of notifications with columns displaying the date, subject, and message of each, as well as a “Delete All” button in the top right. Notifications referring to specific items in the repository will include an active link to the item. The page’s left sidebar highlights its “Notifications” item also, under “Your Activity”.
