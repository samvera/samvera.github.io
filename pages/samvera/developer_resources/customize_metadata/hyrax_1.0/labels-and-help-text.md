<ul class='info'><li>This tutorial assumes that you generated a work type name GenericWork.  If you used a different name, substitute that name for all occurrences of GenericWork and generic_work.</li></ul>

## Labels and help text

One of the generated files includes `config/locales/generic_work.en.yml` in which many of the labels used on forms and show pages for the new work type are defined. You can modify these labels and also add labels for any new properties defined.

Application specific labels are defined in `config/locales/hyrax.en.yml` which was created when you generated your Hyrax app.
