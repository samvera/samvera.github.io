<ul class='info'><li>This tutorial assumes that you generated a work type name GenericWork.  If you used a different name, substitute that name for all occurrences of GenericWork and generic_work.</li></ul>

## Generating a new work type

We'll begin by generating a new Hyrax work-type for Hyrax for use in the tutorial. We'll call our work type `GenericWork` although you could use any name you choose (e.g. `Image`, `ETD`, etc). The first step is to run this generator:

```
$ bin/rails generate hyrax:work GenericWork
```

This will generate a number of files into your application. Now we can update these files to handle our customized metadata.
