<ul class="info"><li><b>Best practice for classes is for each class to have a single responsibility.</b></li></ul>

Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC) are the basic patterns provided by Rails. To adhere to the goal of single responsibility, we do not want to include code beyond the minimum required for these classes. Additional processing and business logic are addressed in classes outside the MVC classes. Design patterns are used to organize business logic that falls beyond the basic MVC pattern.

| Pattern                                              | Primary Goal                                                                                                                                        |

| Forms                                                | Isolate new/edit form views from business logic code. Primarily used to control which and how data fields are displayed in the forms.               |
