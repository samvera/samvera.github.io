### What does it mean for a collection to be discoverable?

Collections that are discoverable will have the collection itself included in search results, showing the collection title and summary metadata.

### Are items of a discoverable collection discoverable?

Not necessarily. The collection's setting for discovery does NOT effect the discoverability of the items in the collection. All items in a collection are discoverable based on their own settings.

WHY NOT? The items in a collection can be in other collections which also have discoverability settings. It would be complicated to sort through all the possible combinations and produce an intuitive, predicatable behavior.

Yes, for public users. For logged in users, collections will show up in search results if they can edit or read the collection.

### If a collection type is NOT discoverable, can I make collections of that type discoverable?

No, if the collection type of a collection has `discoverable=false`, the edit form will not show the Discovery tab. All collections of this type will have `visibility=Private`.

### Why can't I set a collection to Public?
