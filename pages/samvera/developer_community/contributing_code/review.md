# Code review

## When Submitting a Pull Request

When you have code ready to be reviewed, and it meets the [code guidelines](code.md), open a pull
request to ask for it to be merged into the codebase.

To help make the review go smoothly, here are some general guidelines:

- Your pull request should address a single issue.
  - It's better to split large or complicated PRs into discrete steps if possible. This makes
    review more manageable and reduces the risk of conflicts with other changes.
- Give your pull request a brief title, and use the description to provide key information:
  - Provide a list of the key changes
  - If your PR addresses an existing ticket, link to it with "Fixes #123". This will make it easy
    to refer back to the original ticket and automatically close it when the PR is merged.
  - If you've discussed the issue, or just want to alert someone to your PR, tag them by including
    their @username.
  - Link to relevant resources, such as Wiki pages, mailing list threads, specifications, or other
    tickets. This makes it easier to understand the full context of your PR.
- Please be patient. Your PR may not be reviewed right away, since the people doing code review
  are often busy, and may be traveling, in a different time zone, or otherwise not available to
  review your code immediately.
  - Especially if it's blocking other work, it's fine to ask someone to review, either by tagging
    them in a comment or asking on [Slack](communication.md#slack) or at the [weekly tech call](communication.md#tech-call).
- Respond to code review comments, with discussion where it's appropriate or by pushing additional
  commits to the branch. They will be added to the same PR automatically.
- If another PR is merged and conflicts with your changes, you may need to rebase your PR.
  - See [GitHub's rebasing documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) and
    [One Commit Per Pull Request](http://ndlib.github.io/practices/one-commit-per-pull-request/)
    for more information on rebasing.

## When Reviewing a Pull Request

Pull requests are evaluated in many different ways; fortunately, we have tools to help us with code
review so that human review can focus on overall code quality and maintainability. For instance, we
use:

- A continous integration (CI) service, to ensure the test suite is passing (typically CircleCI or Travis)
- Rubocop, to be consistent w/ a baseline of Ruby style conventions
- Coveralls, to ensure code changes are covered by test changes
- Hound, to be consistent w/ Javascript and CSS style conventions
- CodeClimate, to flag obvious code smells early for remediation

When reviewing a pull request, please take the time to review the changes and get a sense of what
is being changed.

The key things to focus on are:

- Are the PR description and commit messages clear?
- Do the functional code changes match the PR description?
- Does the PR contain tests for new features or bugfixes?
  - Not all PRs require tests, such as wording changes or simple refactoring.
- Does the commit contain more than it should? Are two separate concerns being addressed in one
  commit?

As a reviewer, it's also your responsibility to make sure:

- Does the submitter have a signed CLA? (Indicated by a `cla-signed` label in github.)
- Did the CI tests complete successfully?
- Is there a significant drop in code coverage?
- Do all new or changed methods, modules, and classes have comments?

## Merging Pull Requests

When merging pull requests:

- Give discussion time to settle down. When there is a contentious discussion, please allow 24
  hours before merging to make sure everyone's had a chance to respond.
- It is considered "poor form" to merge your own request, and you should be cautious when merging
  pull requests from other developers at your own insitution.
- If you are uncertain, bring other contributors into the conversation by creating a comment that
  includes their @username.
- If you like the pull request, but want others to chime in, create a +1 comment and tag a user.
