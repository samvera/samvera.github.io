# Communication

This page details the communication channels used by developers in the Samvera community.  For more
information on broader community communication, please see the Samvera wiki
[Get in touch!](https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87460391) page.

## Regular Calls

* [Weekly Technical Call](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Notes+from+Meetings+and+Calls) for technical discussion, and coordinating releases and code review
* [Monthly Partner Call](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Partner+Calls) complements the tech call with a focus on community and functional progress
* Community Sprint Calls are also organized to coordinate development

## Slack

Slack has become the primary mode of synchronous communication in the Samvera community. There is a Samvera Slack team that is used for discussion, questions, announcements, interest groups, and working groups. Topics span very general discussion to in-depth interest/working group work, from metadata work to development coordination. Anyone can create a new channel within the Samvera Slack team once they have registered for an account.

* Slack: [http://samvera.slack.com/](http://samvera.slack.com/)
* Signup form: [http://slack.samvera.org/](http://slack.samvera.org/)

## Mailing Lists

* https://groups.google.com/group/samvera-community for general Samvera discussion
* https://groups.google.com/group/samvera-tech for technical discussion
* and several more listed on [How to Ask for Help](/get-help.html#mailing-lists)

## Wiki

* DuraSpace wiki: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/ for general project
  documentation, meeting notes, and working group pages
  * To request an account, please email [sysadmin@duraspace.org](mailto:sysadmin@duraspace.org)
* GitHub codebase-specific wikis for technical documentation and tutorials: e.g.,
  * https://github.com/samvera/hydra-head/wiki
  * https://github.com/samvera/sufia/wiki

## Conferences

* [SamveraConnect](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Connect+Meetings): the annual go-to
  event for the entire Samvera community, primarily geared towards connecting with fellow Samvera
  community members to learn how they are using Samvera
* Developer Congresses: these community hackfests tend to be held 1-2 times per year, and have a strong record of delivering advances in our community codebases and helping to onboard new Samvera developers
* Other Conferences
  * [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org/conference)
  * [LDCX](http://library.stanford.edu/projects/ldcx)
  * [Open Repositories](http://openrepositories.org/)
  * [Digital Library Federation Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/)

## Training

* [SamveraCamp](https://curationexperts.com/our-services/hydra-camp/): for many partners, one of the
  first steps to joining the Samvera community was, and remains, sending a team of software developers
  to SamveraCamp to learn the common practices of our community. We generally hold 3-4 SamveraCamps per
  year.

## IRC

Slack is more active, but there is still a #samvera IRC channel on chat.freenode.net.  Connect
using your favorite IRC client, or using http://webchat.freenode.net/.  If you are new to IRC, the
Code4lib [IRC wiki page](http://code4lib.org/irc) is a good introduction.
