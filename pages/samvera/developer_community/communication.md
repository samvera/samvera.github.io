# Communication

This page details the communication channels used by developers in the Samvera community. For more
information on broader community communication, please see the Samvera wiki
[Get Started in the Samvera Community](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405211682/Getting+Started+in+the+Samvera+Community) page.

## Regular Calls

- [Weekly Technical Call](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405211059/Notes+from+Tech+Meetings+and+Calls) for technical discussion, and coordinating releases and code review
- [Monthly Partner Call](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405211008/Samvera+Partner+Calls) complements the tech call with a focus on community and functional progress
- Community Sprint Calls are also organized to coordinate development

## Slack

Slack has become the primary mode of synchronous communication in the Samvera community. There is a Samvera Slack team that is used for discussion, questions, announcements, interest groups, and working groups. Topics span very general discussion to in-depth interest/working group work, from metadata work to development coordination. Anyone can create a new channel within the Samvera Slack team once they have registered for an account.

- Slack: [http://samvera.slack.com/](http://samvera.slack.com/)
- Signup form: [http://slack.samvera.org/](http://slack.samvera.org/)

## Mailing Lists

- https://groups.google.com/group/samvera-community for general Samvera discussion
- https://groups.google.com/group/samvera-tech for technical discussion
- and several more listed on [How to Ask for Help](/get-help.html#mailing-lists)

## Wiki

- Samvera wiki: https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/overview for general project
  documentation, meeting notes, and working group pages
  - To request an account, please email [heather@samvera.org](mailto:heather@samvera.org)
- GitHub codebase-specific wikis for technical documentation and tutorials: e.g.,
  - https://github.com/samvera/hydra-head/wiki
  - https://github.com/samvera/sufia/wiki

## Conferences

- [SamveraConnect](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405210633/Samvera%2BConnect%2BMeetings): the annual go-to
  event for the entire Samvera community, primarily geared towards connecting with fellow Samvera
  community members to learn how they are using Samvera
- Developer Congresses: these community hackfests tend to be held 1-2 times per year, and have a strong record of delivering advances in our community codebases and helping to onboard new Samvera developers
- Other Conferences
  - [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org/conference)
  - [LDCX](http://library.stanford.edu/projects/ldcx)
  - [Open Repositories](http://openrepositories.org/)
  - [Digital Library Federation Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/)

## Training

- [SamveraCamp](https://curationexperts.com/our-services/hydra-camp/): for many partners, one of the
  first steps to joining the Samvera community was, and remains, sending a team of software developers
  to SamveraCamp to learn the common practices of our community. We generally hold 3-4 SamveraCamps per
  year.

## IRC

Slack is more active, but there is still a #samvera IRC channel on chat.freenode.net. Connect
using your favorite IRC client, or using http://webchat.freenode.net/. If you are new to IRC, the
Code4lib [IRC wiki page](http://code4lib.org/irc) is a good introduction.
